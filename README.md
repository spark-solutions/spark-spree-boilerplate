## Environment variables

| variable | description | default value |
|---|---|---|
| DEBUG_ASSETS | Enables/disables [asset debugging in development](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#turning-debugging-off) | false |
| DB_POOL | database connection pool | 5 |
| MEMCACHED_POOL_SIZE | memcache connection pool | 5 |
| SENDGRID_API_KEY | API key to interface Sendgrid API | |
| USER_ID, GROUP_ID | Align docker containers with host user/group | 1000, 1000 |


## Docker User & File permissions

To avoid file ownership problems, the host user is shared with docker development container(s).

Basically, we create an user in each container, having the same UID/GID as your host one.
This setup allows to create files from inside of each container; generated files will be editable on the host,
without further changes to file permissions.

#### More about UID/GID (UserID / GroupID)

_On Linux systems, the first normal user (non-root) is identified by it's name, and a numeric ID (1000).
On Fedora/CentOS systems the UID is 500. As long as two users have the same IDs, their name is not important to determine
file permissions._

The default value is `1000` for both UID and GID. Please use the `.env` file to change them, if you need to.

**Note:** this configuration has not been tested on Windows yet
