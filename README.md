# Spree Starter

This is a starter kit for [Spree Commerce](https://spreecommerce.org) - the open-source e-commerce platform for Rails. It is a great starting point for any Rails developer to quickly build an e-commerce store.

## Installation

```bash
bin/setup
```

If you want to use sample data (products, categories), you can load it using the following command:

```bash
bin/rake spree_sample:load
```

### Launch local server

```bash
bin/rails s
```

## Deployment

### Using Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Using Render

</a>

Note that sample data does not automatically get loaded when deploying to Render with the default configuration. In order to add sample data, run the following commands in the web service shell:

```bash
bin/rails db:seed
bin/rake spree_sample:load
```

After that, you'll be ready to deploy to render.

## Troubleshooting

### libvips error

If you encounter an error like the following:

```bash
LoadError: Could not open library 'vips.so.42'
```

Please check that libvips is installed with `vips -v`, and if it is not installed, follow [installation instructions here](https://www.libvips.org/install.html).
